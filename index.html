                Aluminum driveway gates are becoming more and more popular because of how strong and durable they are. The wide choices for design and style is also
                another reason why this type of gate is preferred by many people over wooden or iron gates.

                Here are the reasons why a lot of homeowners choose to put up custom made gates made of aluminum.

                1. Cost : Aluminum gates are less costly than steel gates at least nowadays as 10 years ago they were allot more expensive than Steel gates. If you like an
                elaborate and very decorative gate, the cost of wrought steel would be more, but with aluminum, the same design can be within your allotted budget.

                2. Weight: Aluminum custom made gates are very light compare to Steel gates, making them a lot easier to open compared to those made of iron. This may be
                just as important point when it comes to automatic gates, aluminum only lets minimal tear and ware on the rollers and hinges sliding gates. Because materials
                are not heavy, the automated opening system will surely stay in good condition for a longer time period and in some cases extending the life of the gate
                openers by 50%.

                3. Durability:Since aluminum is not damaged by rust or corrosion, your gate can serve you well for many years. All our gates designs are made from solid plate
                aluminum that is ½ to 1" inch thick. A gate made of solid aluminum rods are a bit heavier but way lighter and so we are able to use thick material which makes
                our work stand out.

                4. Appearance and Options. When talking about sheer beauty, Our aluminum gate are so elegant as the materials that we use in most cases are TWICE thick than
                a metal gate . You also have a wide choice in terms of colors as we offer one of the largest select of Powder Coat Oven Baked in the net, larger selection
                styles, and custom sizes.

                5. Maintenance: Maintenance is out of the question Aluminum is the way to go, since it does not corrode, unlike with wrought Iron ( steel ), you are not required
                the Maintenance to up keep your gate no sanding,priming,re-painting for many ,many,many years to come. With aluminum custom made gates, you can save
                time, money, and effort in maintenance This gates are capable of enduring different types of elements without flaking, chipping, or cracking.
